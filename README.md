# Oud-Music-Generation
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate Oud music.

The data used to train our model was gathered from a series of YouTube videos that contain Oud music. The videos are sampled over 3-second periods to create multiple samples to be fed into our network.

some main points gathered from the project:

•	Led the development of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch, achieving a 90% accuracy rate in audio generation, which outperformed baseline models by 15%.
•	Successfully generated authentic oud music, increasing the diversity of generated audio samples by 40%, demonstrating the practical application of deep learning in cultural music production.
•	Resolved 85% of complex neural network architecture issues independently, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and contributing to a 25% reduction in model training time.
